•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops financial plans. They would like to protect client data in their web interface. They needed to implement a checksum into their file validation system. 

•	What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I did well at using static testing to identify vulnerabilities. Identifying and resolving security vulnerabilities is extremely important. In this case, keeping code secure means keeping customer personal and financial data secure. 

•	Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found dealing with the sheer number of vulnerabilities to be overwhelming. Learning to suppress false positives was helpful to work through them. 

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To resolve vulnerabilities and increase layers of security, I updated dependencies to their latest versions. In the future, I would use the same dependency check tools to assess the security of dependencies. 

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To make sure the code was secure, I used the dependency checker to identify vulnerabilities introduced by the dependencies. After refactoring the code, I ran the dependency checker and rebuilt the application to ensure that no new issues were introduced.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I learned to approach code with a mindset of security, and how to incorporate secure coding practices. I also learned how to use tools such as the dependency checker to identify known vulnerabilities. These skills will be beneficial to me in future assignments. 

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I would show my understanding of secure coding practices and my ability to utilize cryptography to create secure programs.
